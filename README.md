# OpenVPN for Docker

Quick instructions:

Edit the environment variables half way down runDockVPN.sh and then run it:
```bash
vim runDockVPN.sh
./runDockVPN.sh
```
it will print out the directory where your OpenVPN configuration files
are stored and you should get those (SECURELY!!!) to your local directory:
```bash
rsync -avH --rsync-path="sudo rsync" userWithSudo@dockerHost:<directoryFromScript>/ OpenVPN-Config/
```
or
```bash
docker run --rm --volumes-from OpenVPN-Config busybox tar cvf - /etc/openvpn/ \
    | ssh mobile@jailBrokeniPhone "mkdir OpenVPN-Config; tar -xvf - -C OpenVPN-Config/"
```

then you can directly import those files into Ubuntu's Network Manager,
TunnelBlick, iPhone or Android's OpenVPN Connect, or pretty much anywhere.

Since the configuration files are in a seperate volume only container named OpenVPN-Config,
any reboots or restarts will start you back off where you were.  Just re-run the script.
If you need to add hosts to your server, just edit and re-run the script.  It will restart
OpenVPN, but it will re-create the needed files.  A new script to add hosts without a restart
is easy to create, and will hopefully be added later.

## OpenVPN details

We use `tun` mode, because it works on the widest range of devices.
`tap` mode, for instance, does not work on Android, except if the device
is rooted.
